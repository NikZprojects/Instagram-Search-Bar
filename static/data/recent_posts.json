Creating a good mocktail doesn't have to be complicated. There are a lot of non-alcoholic spirits out there now that can be delicious when used properly.  Even more, utilizing something other than tart and sweet ingredients can also help. In today's cocktail I used a lemon tonic from @fevertreemixers, which brings a bitter component. This drink is bright, refreshing, and full of lemon and blueberry deliciousness.\nüèòÔ∏èüèòÔ∏èüèòÔ∏è\nRecipe:\n- 1 oz blueberry syrup\n- 6 mint leaves\n- 2 dashes orange blossom water\n- 3/4 oz lemon sherbet\n- 3 oz bitter lemon soda\nü•Ç\nAdd the mint, orange blossom water, and blueberry syrup to a tall glass.
