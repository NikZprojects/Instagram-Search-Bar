It's not the easiest sipping drink (40% ABV), but the spice and flavor help mellow the mouth feel. Woody bouquet. I get the feeling that snaps rely more on the flavors to carry them than utilizing sugar like other herbal liquors do. It's light, but deep. I get hints of cinnamon, rosemary, and cherry. I also taste something I can't quite name, but that might be bog myrtle (I'm only guessing that because it's written on the back of the bottle. ...I have no idea what \"bog myrtle\" tastes like!) I've tried this both room temperature and ice cold. The latter is the suggested method by Danes, but I actually prefer the former, I think. Chilling the beverage cuts out depth that you get at room temperature.\n\nOverall, I'm quite pleased, and can't wait to try another!\n\n#DanishLife #denmark #Snaos #akvavit #bogmyrtle #porse #cocktails #drinks #MixedDrinks #Mixology #HomeBartender #HomeMixology #HappyHour #cheers #skål #Alcohol #liquor #liqueur #review #boozereview","timestamp":"2020-05-13T14:00:43+0000"},{"id":"18059593612236547","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBqJwtYleX7/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/104298667_291765278857005_1745352435036539457_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=zt7t7tRkpYcAX8m4mv4&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=b11b06b1ab4e397a09a43a47b5004123&oe=60226EDE","caption":"Happy 25th birthday to @mr.johs .

One adds spice, one adds body, one adds sweetness.

I'm not personally doing sober October, but I'm sure some of you are. So here is something to help you scratch that itch. I came up with this one almost two years ago for the @homebarawards. I'm still a sucker for a zero-proof drink that aren't syrupy sweet nonsense.\n🌳🏘️🌳\nTo be honest, that may be my biggest pet peeves in mixology: \"mocktails\" that are nothing but juice and syrup and make you think you are back in kindergarten slurping down an off-brand Sunny D. Creating a good mocktail doesn't have to be complicated. There are a lot of non-alcoholic spirits out there now that can be delicious when used properly. Even more, utilizing something other than tart and sweet ingredients can also help. In today's cocktail I used a lemon tonic from @fevertreemixers, which brings a bitter component. This drink is bright, refreshing, and full of lemon and blueberry deliciousness.\n🏘️🏘️🏘️\nRecipe:\n- 1 oz blueberry syrup\n- 6 mint leaves\n- 2 dashes orange blossom water\n- 3/4 oz lemon sherbet\n- 3 oz bitter lemon soda\n🥂\nAdd the mint, orange blossom water, and blueberry syrup to a tall glass. Gently muddle the mint. Add the lemon sherbet and about half the soda. Fill the glass 3/4 full with ice and swizzle. Add the rest of the soda and top with ice.

The topic: The Big Screen. A movie inspired cocktail. There's no movie that deserves a drink more than 'Citizen Kane'. Called \"the most influential movie ever made\" and \"the #1 movie of all time,\" nominated for 9 academy awards and winner of Best Original Screenplay (1942), this film has withstood the test of time and still tops lists by USA today and IGN. I couldn't help but use the imagery, inspiration, and innovation to drive my cocktail.\n---\nThe movie:\n'Citizen Kane' follows the journey of reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he tries to uncover the meaning of the final words of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Thompson follows Kane's troubled life from when his family became unexpectedly wealthy, to the building of his newspaper empire, through two marriages and subsequent divorces, to the raising of a castle, all concluding with his lonely final moments as he uttered his last word: \"Rosebud.\" The film paints the portrait of a life corrupted by money, control, and an unsatisfied longing for something else.\n---\nThe drink:\n'Rosebud'\n1 sugar cube\n4-6 rose petals\n1 bar spoon of rose syrup\n2oz American whiskey \nMuddle sugar cube, rose petals, and rose syrup together. Add whiskey. Add ice and stir. Double strain into a glass over an ice ball (snow-globe) containing a rose.\n---\nThe symbolism:\n*The picture is grainy and black and white with dynamic lighting to mirror the film itself.\n*The drink is a take-off of an Old Fashioned. The simplicity of the drink represents the simplicity of the life Charles Foster Kane longed for and had ripped away from him. His fortune, art, and prestige never made him content.\n*The rose petals and syrup add the floral notes giving the drink its name: 'Rosebud'\n*I chose American whiskey because, as the man himself said: \"I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN.\"\n*The garnish is a rose encased in a \"snow-globe.\" These are the memories Kane yearns so much to have to fill his cold and empty life.\n\n#whiskey #rose #blackandwhite #CitizenKane #homebarawards #mixology #HomeBartender","timestamp":"2018-03-30T15:04:30+0000"},{"id":"18063161758210606","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CADN-3mlc2c/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/96397760_165033108284419_8741861924795962921_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=Fo4kCaUEtU0AX-PZ_LL&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=3fa5c9b988cb4715b848c35b7d390f6b&oe=60230535","caption":"I love this post from @thebitterfairy for three reasons: (A) it sounds delicious and I'm seriously going to try it... Blue cheese in a martini??? Awesome! (2) She is bold and unapologetic and that's wonderful! (III) I love the little sword. ***\nI will not apologize. Everyone has an opinion on what makes a martini perfect, but my opinion is that the perfect martini is the one that you love best. So if you are the sort who is always going to wish you had one more olive no matter how many there are, who wants olives AND pickled onions, who actually wants to taste the vermouth, who also wants stinky cheese, and who wants ice because you want your damn martini to stay cold the entire time you're enjoying it... Well then, clearly you are me. 🙃 And I am here to stand up for the right to boldly have your druthers in a martini, in a world where everyone's a critic. ⁣\n⁣\nThis martini has a secret weapon: blue cheese. My wild, sweet, hilarious friend @cocktailsmandurah, who is somewhat famous (notorious?) for her ability to make the most intensely delicious syrups and infusions imaginable, persuaded me to make a blue cheese fat-washed gin (see her page for recipe), and oh my holy word, it is so fracking delicious that it's hard to stop thinking about even for a day. If you like salty, funky, cheesy things, this could become your new obsession. It makes the ultimate savory gin martini.⁣\n⁣\nThis cocktail is packed with blue cheese-stuffed olives, anchovy-stuffed olives, and chile-spiced pickled onions. Stinky cheese, salty fishes, and spicy/vinegar-y onions, and gin. The very dream. Which is why I made a not-tiny one. I mean, who wants the dream martini that's gone in the blink of an eye?

With a few exceptions, I shy away from this preferring, instead, to use schnapps or a similar liqueur. One doesn't need cinnamon vodka when one has regular vodka and cinnamon schnapps. Just mix the two together. Is it the same? Not exactly, but it stands as a decent substitute. The sugar in the schnapps also helps make the drink more approachable, and you can mediate exactly how much flavor you want based on how much schnapps you add. The best part is, these bottles tend to be cheap ($6-$15 a bottle) and will last for a while. So, in the future, instead of picking up raspberry rum, try some white rum and raspberry schnapps...you might just find your inner mixologist!\n\n#wednesdaywisdom #schnapps #fakeittillyoumakeit #substitute #vodka #rum #flavor #average #notfancy #simpledrink #cocktails #drinks #MixedDrinks #Mixology #HomeBartender #cheers #Alcohol #liquor #liqueur @de_kuyper_cocktails","timestamp":"2018-08-08T15:01:36+0000"},{"id":"17865411946258902","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkiE3CAguop/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/36032533_2000090846907081_7882073374019551232_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=EttIT_JU4rIAX8CsS1w&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=699117cc6f75bdf3f71e2ede7f453f2d&oe=60236F13","caption":"Guys!!
