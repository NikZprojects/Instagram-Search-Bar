[{"id":0,"caption":"There's an amazing gin bar in Aarhus called \"Two Socks\" and I love going there! With the pandemic, that's been harder to get out so the innovative geniuses at @twosocksginbar devised a way to do in-home Gin & Tonic tasting. You place an order for one of their kits and they send you adorable bottles of gin, bottles of various tonics, tons of garnish, and a link to a video (it's in Danish, so English speakers beware (we just mimicked what they did and everything came out great!)) What's more, you even get two socks!! Swipe to the end to see the elegant @kegel_robbe model them.\n\nThis was a great deal economically, a fun way to support a local business, a wonderful exposure to different gins and tonics, and an overall splendid evening. Don't worry, they have two more sets, so we'll be back for more!\n\n#gin #tonic #sampling #tasting #socks #lemonpeel #lime #sexygarnish #cocktails #drinks #MixedDrinks #Mixology #HomeBartender #HomeMixology #HappyHour #cheers #sk√•l #Alcohol #liquor #liqueur","image":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/135539589_2397063683772290_3231408939567784065_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=QLbGJCd9JS8AX-dlcKC&tp=1&oh=753c8c562aeca4634e5a4c4e71e954fd&oe=601F26CA","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CJtNLFIFWCc"},{"id":1,"caption":"My mother always taught me to be sure to eat my fruits and vegetables. ...do you think this mango daiquiri from @niclimdrinks counts? ü§î\n***\n Check out my mango daiquiri.

I'm not personally doing sober October, but I'm sure some of you are. So here is something to help you scratch that itch. I came up with this one almost two years ago for the @homebarawards. I'm still a sucker for a zero-proof drink that aren't syrupy sweet nonsense.\nüå≥üèòÔ∏èüå≥\nTo be honest, that may be my biggest pet peeves in mixology: \"mocktails\" that are nothing but juice and syrup and make you think you are back in kindergarten slurping down an off-brand Sunny D. Creating a good mocktail doesn't have to be complicated. There are a lot of non-alcoholic spirits out there now that can be delicious when used properly. Even more, utilizing something other than tart and sweet ingredients can also help. In today's cocktail I used a lemon tonic from @fevertreemixers, which brings a bitter component. This drink is bright, refreshing, and full of lemon and blueberry deliciousness.\nüèòÔ∏èüèòÔ∏èüèòÔ∏è\nRecipe:\n- 1 oz blueberry syrup\n- 6 mint leaves\n- 2 dashes orange blossom water\n- 3/4 oz lemon sherbet\n- 3 oz bitter lemon soda\nü•Ç\nAdd the mint, orange blossom water, and blueberry syrup to a tall glass. Gently muddle the mint. Add the lemon sherbet and about half the soda. Fill the glass 3/4 full with ice and swizzle. Add the rest of the soda and top with ice.
